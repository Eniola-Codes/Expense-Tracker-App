# Description

**Details**

This is a single page application which is an expense tracker that will make viewing, understanding and managing your expenses easier.

The application has a form to receive user expense data, the form takes on 3 inputs, which are the expense title, amount and date(between year 2019 - 2022).

![Form](https://github.com/Eniola-Codes/Food-Order-App/blob/main/src/components/assets/item.png?raw=true)

When a user submits a form, the data is added to the list of expenses.

![expense item](https://github.com/Eniola-Codes/Food-Order-App/blob/main/src/components/assets/item.png?raw=true)

The list of expenses can then be filtered by year, the user is allowed to filter expenses between the year 2019 - 2022.

I then created a chart system that calculates the total amount of expenses then split them across the different months in the chart, i use css styles to add a fill color to the container of each month based on their relative amount compared to the total amount.

**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are React.js and Css

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the functionalities below : 

- Props to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Seperation of concerns so i can have leaner components and easily readable code.
